# cljslein

Attempt to create a ClojureScript project with Leinigen2, nrepl, piggieback.

Not trying to bring in cljsbuild yet.

## Folders structure

### src/clj
_clojure source files root folder_

- src/clj/compile.clj : namespace with 'dev function to compile src/cljs/piggieback_browser.cljs to target/war/js/piggieback_browser.js
- src/clj/cljsrepl_client.clj : namespace with function 'start to start the cljs repl client listening on port 9000, and serving static content for folders resources/public/ and target/war/ 


### src/cljs
_clojurescript source files root folder_

- src/cljs/piggieback_browser.cljs : clojurescript namespace bootstrapping a connection to port 9000 to serve as the javascript evaluation environment


### resources/public
_static resources to be served by the http server. Resources right under resources/public will be mapped to their name at the root of the server URL_

- resources/public/hello-dev.html : dev entry point of our single-page application. Will be reached through http://localhost:9000/hello-dev.html during development once the repl client will be manually started

## Launch the development environment

_pre-requisite: lein2 preview9 of higher installed and setup in $PATH_

Start an nrepl server and command line client:
```
cd /path/to/cljslein
lein repl
```

The first time, and everytime the target/ folder is cleaned up, recompile src/cljs/piggieback_browser.cljs to target/war/js/piggieback_browser.js:
```
(require 'compile)
(compile/dev)
```

Start the RPL part of the clojurescript REPL from the Clojure REPL:
```
(require '[cljsrepl-client :as rpl])
(rpl/start)
```

Open a browser to the page http://localhost:9000/hello-dev.html

Back in the rpl, try to evaluate something:
```
 (+ 1 2)
```
